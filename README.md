## Blackjack-Game

### About
A blackjack game, built with python. It will be improved with new features when I learn new skill in python.

### Player's Goal
Beat the automated dealer's hand without going over 21. You start with two cards facing up and 100 dollars. The automated dealer starts with one card facing up and one facing down. Player can chooes Hit or Stand to ask another card or to hold your total and end your turn, respectively.

### Three scenarios of Gameover:
1. If the player busts(exceeds 21), the automated dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
2. Automated dealer's sum is greater than player's sum and still under 21, the dealer wins.
3. If the automated dealer busts and the player does not, the player wins.

### How will the money be calculated?
If you win, you get 1.5 amount of your betting money, otherwise, you lose your betting money.

### Special Rules:
1. Face cards(Jack, Queen, King) count as value of 10.
2. Aces count as either 1 or 11, whichever the player prefers.
